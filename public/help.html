			<h2>Skills</h2>
			<p>
				Each idol can equip a skill that aids the player during the game. Every skill is associated with
				a cool time; using a skill resets its charge to the cool time, and the skill cannot be used again
				until its charge is zero. Revealing a tile reduces the charge of all skills on living idols by 1,
				and all idols can use their skills at the beginning of every level.
			</p>
			<p>
				The different skill types are as follows:
